# Cynet
Cynet is a Minecraft Hacking tool for account cracking, server exploitation and other stuff while leaving minimal traces. Although some modules may not work without an internet connection. Cynet uses Yggdrasil authservers, Mojang API and different server APIs to its advantage. It attempts to be filled with different options so it works your way. The entire program's code is written to take up minimal space.
It is filled with modules. A complete list:
1. [Combo] Account checker
2. [Combo] Checking if account is migrated
3. Premium server botspam
4. Cracked server botspam
5. Username scraper
6. Hacks list
7. Proxy checker
8. (Single account) Account Cracker
9. [Server] IP Resolver
10. [User] IP Resolver
11. Server DOS/DDoS
12. API Key Abuser

It also provides links to other useful external tools such as Egg.Crack and another username scraper incase it doesn't work. This program is free.

### Prerequisites

The program uses python and requires python to run. Only the Hub is in exe format.

You will need to install the following modules and programs:
- PyQt5 and Qt5 (https://www.metachris.com/2016/03/how-to-install-qt56-pyqt5-virtualenv-python3/)
- Python (3.6.5)
- Only tested on Windows

All modules will be automatically installed, but here is a list of them that you might need to install:
- cryptography (module) `pip install cryptography`
- win10toast `pip install win10toast`
- certifi `pip install certifi`

### Installing

1. Install Qt5 and PyQt via `pip install pyqt5`. If it doesn't work, detailed instructions are here: https://www.metachris.com/2016/03/how-to-install-qt56-pyqt5-virtualenv-python3/
2. Download Cynet-installer.exe (just that single file). It will present you with preferences for the installation
3. Follow through. It's recommended to download all different modules (they aren't very big.)
4. Completed! Just run the Cynet shortcut on your desktop and it will open.
